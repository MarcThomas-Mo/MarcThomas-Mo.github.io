    <h2>Data Scientist and former distribution director with experience as business analyst with newly aquired skills in 
        Python with a strong background in Excel and SQL. Currently a distribution business analyst with newly acquired skills 
        in Python with a strong background working in Excel and SQL. I have expanded my skillset  by completing the Data 
        Analytics Bootcamp through the Unveristy of Texas. I have been a buyer, a musician, a massage therapist and have
         grown into the role of director for a distribution center. Through this journey I have gained valuable skils in 
         project management, leadership, teaching, process improvement and documentation. After going through a rough stretch
          in life I have come out with a new appreciation of what I truly want to do. I love data and diving into it. Given the
        varied path I have taken to get here, I bring a unique perspective to everyday problems.  I am excited to bring work 
        with data in ways that can help contribute to the world.</h2>
